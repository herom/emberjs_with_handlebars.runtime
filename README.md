emberjs_with_handlebars.runtime
===============================

Proves that Builds with Grunt.js and the "grunt-neuter" Task fail if Handlebars.runtime > 1.0.0 is used

===============================

use **grunt fail** to create the *application.fail.js* which uses `ember.min.js 1.3.0` along with `handlebars.runtime.js 1.3.0`
and **grunt pass** to create the *application.pass.js* which uses `ember.min.js 1.3.0` along with `handlebars.runtime.js 1.0.0`
